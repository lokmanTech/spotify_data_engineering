# spotify_data_engineering
This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project using AWS Cloud and PySpark, from Spotify data information. The project involves extracting Spotify data using APIs, transforming the data with PySpark, storing it in AWS S3, and performing data analysis. The project involves extracting, transforming, and loading Spotify data to build a data pipeline. Key components include:

- Data Extraction: Retrieving Spotify data using APIs.
- Data Transformation: Processing data with PySpark.
- Data Storage: Storing transformed data in AWS S3.
- Data Analysis: Analyzing data using PySpark.

### Technologies Used
- AWS Cloud: S3, IAM
- PySpark
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

### Project Structure
- data_extraction/: Scripts for extracting data from Spotify APIs.
